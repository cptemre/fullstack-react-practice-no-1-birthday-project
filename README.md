# BIRTHDAY PROJECT

## FULLSTACK REACT PRACTICE PROJECT NO: 1

1. I created this project to practice my skills using Javascript, React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS.

2. I practiced the useState hook in this project

3. This is a notification page for birthdays.

4. It tries to get the data from the cloud. If it won't be successful it gets the information from the local hobbits.js file. Because there is no password of my cloud account in this repository, it will take the data locally

5. You can dismiss one or all together.
